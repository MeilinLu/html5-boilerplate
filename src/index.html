	The mission of the Ying Wu College of Computing Sciences (CCS), which was established in  2001, is to bring
	education in a broad range of computing disciplines to students on  campus and at a distance to carry out
	cutting-edge research while working closely in  the industry. CCS offers bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral
	degrees in multiple fields of  computing science, Web and information systems and a multidisciplinary
	undergraduate degree in information technology. 

	CCS resides on one of the most computing-intensive campuses in the world, helping  NJIT educate one of the
	largest groups of information technology students in the nation  in the applications of new technologies as
	learning tools. Not coincidentally, New Jersey  is one of the leading states for computing and high technology
	businesses. Thirty of the  nation's fastest-growing technology companies are based in the state, and New Jersey
	ranks seventh in the nation as a cyberstate and eighth for venture capital investment— $3.5 billion—in
	information technology and software. Additionally, New Jersey offers  the second-highest wages in the nation for
	technology workers. CCS graduates frequently  land creatively satisfying and intellectually challenging jobs at
	major companies like  IBM, Mercedes-Benz and Pfizer.
